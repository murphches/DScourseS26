 \section{Brief Summary}
 
 I am interested in economics because I think it is the thread that ties us all together. I find educational and environmental economics to be the most interesting as they are involved in most policy initiatives recently. I took this class because I felt it would be a good way to learn programming as it relates to economics. The BA/MA has a big data section as well, so this class would fit well within that. I will likely want to do my project on behavior patterns in schools and educational outcomes of those issues. Both my two sisters and dad are school teachers here in Norman at Irving Middle School and Kennedy Elementary. I see the effect that poor behavior has on teachers and want to see what the result is on the students they teach. My goal for this class is to be able to use R with greater fluency and independence. After graduation, I am looking into economic research or banking.
